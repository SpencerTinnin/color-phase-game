# color-phase-game
This game was created during a 48-hour game jam taking place at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte in 2016.
The topic given was "Color". 
I was the sole member of my team, so the entire game (including the character model) was made by me during that period. Models were made in Blender, and the game was built in Unity.
You can download Windows, Mac OS, and Linux versions in releases. Or you can view the WebGL version here: https://spencertinnin.github.io/color-phase-game/ (Note: It technically runs on mobile but was not designed with mobile in mind.)
